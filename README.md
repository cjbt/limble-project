This project is currently deployed using vercel:

\_Live Example: https://cecil-tantay-limble-project-take-home.vercel.app/

## Installation

$ cd limble-project
$ npm install
```

### Notes

- This is a happy path based on requirements
  - Intended for mouse events only; it's missing keyboard interactions
  - Missing accesibility (not part of requirement)
- `contentEditable` div not fully flushed out due to time
  - input text will remain unstyled
- Logic is not production ready. Again, only focusing on happy path.
- This is my first real go at Angular, it's only upwards from here.
