### Notes

- This is a happy path based on requirements
  - Intended for mouse events only; it's missing keyboard interactions
  - Missing accesibility (not part of requirement)
- This is my first real go at Angular, it's only upwards from here.
- Could not test fully since I'm using WSL2, no chrome setup
